(A 28-year-old previously healthy man, presented with, a 6-week history of palpitations)(The symptoms, occurred during, rest)(The symptoms, lasted, up to 30 minutes at a time)(The symptoms, were associated with, dyspnea)(physical examination, yielded, unremarkable findings)(An electrocardiogram (ECG), revealed, normal sinus rhythm)(An electrocardiogram (ECG), revealed, a Wolff– Parkinson– White pre-excitation pattern)(a right-sided accessory pathway, produced, a Wolff– Parkinson– White pre-excitation pattern)(Transthoracic echocardiography, demonstrated, the presence of Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve)(Transthoracic echocardiography, demonstrated, apical displacement of the valve)(Transthoracic echocardiography, demonstrated, formation of an "atrialized" right ventricle)(The anterior tricuspid valve leaflet, was, elongated)(the septal leaflet, was, rudimentary)(Contrast echocardiography using saline, revealed, a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting)(Contrast echocardiography using saline, revealed, bubbles in the left atrium)(The patient, underwent, an electrophysiologic study with mapping of the accessory pathway)(The patient, underwent, radiofrequency ablation)(His post-ablation ECG, showed, a prolonged PR interval)(His post-ablation ECG, showed, an odd "second" QRS complex in leads III, aVF and V2–V4)(abnormal impulse conduction in the "atrialized" right ventricle, was, a consequence of)(The patient, reported, no recurrence of palpitations at follow-up 6 months after the ablation)
